# CSS

## First install

From the command line:

1. Install `grunt-cli` globally with `npm install -g grunt-cli`.
2. Install the [necessary local dependencies](package.json) via `npm install`

When completed, you'll be able to run the various Grunt commands provided from the command line.

**Unfamiliar with `npm`? Don't have node installed?** That's a-okay. npm stands for [node packaged modules](http://npmjs.org/) and is a way to manage development dependencies through node.js. [Download and install node.js](http://nodejs.org/download/) before proceeding.

## Compiling Bootstrap

### Only compile CSS and JavaScript - `grunt dist`
  `grunt dist` creates the `/dist` directory with compiled files. **Requires [recess](https://github.com/twitter/recess) and [uglify-js](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS).**

#### Watch - `grunt watch`
  This is a convenience method for watching just Less files and automatically building them whenever you save.

# Angularjs

_Note: While angular is client-side-only technology and it's possible to create angular webapps that
don't require a backend server at all, we recommend hosting the project files using a local
webserver during development to avoid issues with security restrictions (sandbox) in browsers. The
sandbox implementation varies between browsers, but quite often prevents things like cookies, xhr,
etc to function properly when an html page is opened via `file://` scheme instead of `http://`._


## How to use angular-seed

Clone the angular-seed repository and start hacking...


### Running the app during development

You can pick one of these options:

* serve this repository with your webserver
* install node.js and run `scripts/web-server.js`

Then navigate your browser to `http://localhost:<port>/app/index.html` to see the app running in
your browser.


### Running the app in production

This really depends on how complex is your app and the overall infrastructure of your system, but
the general rule is that all you need in production are all the files under the `app/` directory.
Everything else should be omitted.

Angular apps are really just a bunch of static html, css and js files that just need to be hosted
somewhere, where they can be accessed by browsers.

If your Angular app is talking to the backend server via xhr or other means, you need to figure
out what is the best way to host the static files to comply with the same origin policy if
applicable. Usually this is done by hosting the files by the backend server or through
reverse-proxying the backend server(s) and a webserver(s).


### Running unit tests

We recommend using [jasmine](http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/) and
[Karma](http://karma-runner.github.io) for your unit tests/specs, but you are free
to use whatever works for you.

Requires [node.js](http://nodejs.org/), Karma (`sudo npm install -g karma`) and a local
or remote browser.

* start `scripts/test.sh` (on windows: `scripts\test.bat`)
  * a browser will start and connect to the Karma server (Chrome is default browser, others can be captured by loading the same url as the one in Chrome or by changing the `config/karma.conf.js` file)
* to run or re-run tests just change any of your source or test javascript files


### End to end testing

Angular ships with a baked-in end-to-end test runner that understands angular, your app and allows
you to write your tests with jasmine-like BDD syntax.

Requires a webserver, node.js + `./scripts/web-server.js` or your backend server that hosts the angular static files.

Check out the
[end-to-end runner's documentation](http://docs.angularjs.org/guide/dev_guide.e2e-testing) for more
info.

* create your end-to-end tests in `test/e2e/scenarios.js`
* serve your project directory with your http/backend server or node.js + `scripts/web-server.js`
* to run do one of:
  * open `http://localhost:port/test/e2e/runner.html` in your browser
  * run the tests from console with [Karma](http://karma-runner.github.io) via
    `scripts/e2e-test.sh` or `script/e2e-test.bat`
